Project Overview

Introduction:
Analysis: Births in the US by Year, State and Education Level of the Mother: 2016-2021 The present project aims to conduct a trend analysis of births in the United States from 2016 to 2021 with regard to variability: mother's educational level, age, geographic location at the state level, birth rates, and changes over a specified period of time.It is in these dimensions that this project seeks to make a contribution through its possible correlations, disparities, and implications for public health policies and interventions.

Objectives:
Examine variations in birth rates across different states over the specified period by looking at the top 10 states by number of births.
Examine the births ratio by gender
Analyze the overall trend of births in the US from 2016 to 2021.
Investigate the relationship between the education level of mothers and birth rates by examining the total number of births by the educational level of mothers.
Analyze the average age trend of birthing mothers in the US from 2016 to 2021.
Analyze the average weight trend of new born babies in the US between 2016 and 2021.
Evaluate the birth spread of new born babies across states with the aid of a geospatial map


Expected Outcomes:


1.Identification of geographic variations in birth rates across the top 10 states by number of births.
2.Determination of gender distribution among newborns, highlighting any disparities in birth ratios.
3.Understanding of the overall trend of births in the US over the specified period, indicating whether birth rates have increased, decreased, or remained stable.
4.Uncovering potential correlations between maternal education level and birth rates through analysis of total births across different educational groups.
5.Analysis of the average age of birthing mothers over the specified period, revealing trends and shifts in maternal age.
6.Examination of the average weight trend of newborn babies between 2016 and 2021, providing insights into potential health implications.
7.Evaluation of birth spread across states using geospatial mapping, identifying regional disparities and informing resource allocation.


Dataset Overview:

This is the dataset for birth rates and other associated data for the 50 states and DC during the period of 2016-2021. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided the dataset. It contains the number of births, gender, birth weight, state, and the year the birth took place. This dataset places special emphasis on detailed information regarding mothers' educational levels. This dataset will allow one to do such things as analyze birth rates as a function of academic groups and geographic location.

The dataset contains rows viewed as categories defined by state, birth year, gender of the baby, and mother's educational level. Three quantities are given for each category: number of births, mother's average age, and average baby weight. The CDC is sensitive to possibly disclosing personal information, so any category with fewer than ten births is suppressed. Data in this set was originally pulled using CDC's WONDER retrieval tool from the webpage CDC Natality.

This dataset is made up of a single table with 9 columns and 5,496 rows of data, below is the data disctionary as regards the columns in this dataset:
